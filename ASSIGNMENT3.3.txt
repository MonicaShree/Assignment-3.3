List the components of hadoop2.X and explain each component in detail

The components of Hadoop 2.X are :
 *HDFS 

 *YARN
 


 * HDFS: 

   It is the Hadoop Distributed File System . It is where the big data is stored using comodity hardware.

   NAMENODE : 

   * It is placed in the master node and stores meta data .

   * This process runs on a cluster . 

   * It reads all metadata from a file named fsimage and stores in memory .

   * It periodically writes the changes to one file named editas edit logs .

   SECONDARY NAMENODE :

   * It can run on a master node or on a seperate node depends on the size of the cluster .
 
   * It manages the metadata for the name node .  

   DATA NODE :

   * They are placed in slave nodes . 
 
   * It stores data in data slots of 64MB by default . 
  
   * It periodically sends heart bits to Name node to show that slave process is running .






 * YARN :

   The YARN consists of resource manager and node manager which are responsible for executing distributed data computation job in hadoop .

  RESOURCE MANAGER :
   
   * This process runs on master node .
   
   * It takes care of sumbmitting job from client and schedules it .

   * It monitors the running job and allocates resources on slave node .
  
   * It tracks the resource utilization with the help of node manager . 
  
   * It uses Application Manager and Scheduler . 
  
  Sheduler - 
   * It carries out scheduling . 
  
   * Responsible to schedule required resources to Applications .

   Application Master :
   
   * Interacts with resource manager scheduler and node manager .

   * Interacts with node manager for executing taks and monitors it . 
   
   *Interacts with Scheduler to get resources . 

 NODE MANAGER

  * Runs on slave nodes .
  
  *It coordinates with Resource manager for task scheduling and traking resource utilization .
  
  * Monitors each resource utilization . 

  * It is used in excution of slave node .
